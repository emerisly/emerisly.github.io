It will take around 30-45 mins to finish.<br>We will be using namesilo to rent domain names, and cloudflare for domain name resolution.</p><h3 id="1-Renting-a-domain"><a href="#1-Renting-a-domain" class="headerlink" title="1. Renting a domain"></a>1. Renting a domain</h3><p>Go to <a href="https://www.namesilo.com/">namesilo</a>.<br>Sign up. If they ask for things like home address, you don’t need to fill out your real info. Just put something on there.<br>After having your account ready, go back to the home page. Search your desired domain name.</p><blockquote><p>Note that some universities or places blocks certain domain ending with some specific letters. For example, Cornell blocks all website ending with .xyz. So make sure you rent a good domain name.</p></blockquote><p>Let’s say I search my own domain emerisly as an example.</p><img src="/2022/01/08/blog-with-personal-url/domain.jpg" class="" loading="lazy"><p>Click on Add, and then Checkout.<br>Checkout directly, and continue to pay with whatever methods you prefer.</p><h3 id="2-Unlock-domain"><a href="#2-Unlock-domain" class="headerlink" title="2.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Before-we-start"><a href="#Before-we-start" class="headerlink" title="Before we start"></a>Before we start</h2><p>A tutorial about how to making a blog like this for yourself!<br>In this tutorial, we will use hexo as the blog framework and github as the server to deploy our blog. (so you don’t have to buy a server).<br>I will make everything as clear as possible so any new starter can follow along.</p><img src="/2022/01/07/how-to-make-your-own-blog/yes.jpeg" class="" loading="lazy"><h2 id="Ok-Let’s-do-it"><a href="#Ok-Let’s-do-it" class="headerlink" title="Ok, Let’s do it"></a>Ok, Let’s do it</h2><p>I’d say it would take approximately 3+ hours for an experienced programmer to build a blog like this, and maybe 8+ hours if this is your first time building a blog. (with personalized theme and url)</p><h3 id="1-A-New-Github-Repo"><a href="#1-A-New-Github-Repo" class="headerlink" title="1. A New Github Repo"></a>1. A New Github Repo</h3><p>Create a new github repo called yourGitHubUserName.github.io on your github. Here is <a href="https://github.com/emerisly/emerisly.github.io">my repo</a> as an example.</p><h3 id="2-Download-Git-and-set-info"><a href="#2-Download-Git-and-set-info" class="headerlink" title="2. Download Git and set info"></a>2. Download Git and set info</h3><p><a href="https://git-scm.com/download">Download Git</a> first if you haven’t done so.<br>Then, open your terminal or command prompt (I’ll just all it command from here) and set user.name and user.email info. You can do it from some root dir.</p><blockquote><p>do not put the quote in your command, and remove “–global” if you do not wish to set a global info.</p></blockquote><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">git</span> config --global user.name <span class="token string">"yourGitHubUsername"</span><span class="token function">git</span> config --global user.email <span class="token string">"yourGitHubEmail"</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre><h3 id="3-SSH-key"><a href="#3-SSH-key" class="headerlink" title="3. SSH key"></a>3. SSH key</h3><p>Now we generate an ssh key and link it to our github (so later we can deploy blog to your github repo smoothly without entering username and password every time we deploy)</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash">ssh-keygen -t rsa -C <span class="token string">"yourGitHubEmail"</span><span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><p>Hit enter three times for the default location with no password.<br>If it says something about already exists a ssh key, it is up to you to create a new one or use the old key. If you generate a new key, the old key can no longer be used for the repo linked with it. (Just saying is for students that maybe have a different github account linked to school. Two accounts cannot share the same ssh key.)<br>Find the file called “id_rsa.pub” on your laptop or copy the following code to your command to display “id_rsa.pub”‘s content in your command window:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">cat</span> ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><p>Copy everything in the file, starting and including “ssh-rsa” all the way to “@xxxmail.com”. This is your public key that you will put on github and share with others.</p><blockquote><p>Also notice there is a file called “id_rsa”. This is your private key and never publish this online or share it with anyone. If you are interested in how RSA key works and its algorithms, check it out <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rsa-algorithm-cryptography/">here</a>!</p></blockquote><p>Now Open <a href="https://github.com/settings/keys">GitHub Setting Keys</a> page and create a new SSH Key.<br>Use any title your want, and paste the key you just copied. Click “Add SSH key” to save the key.<br>To check if you setup the key successfully, copy and paste the following code into your command and hit enter.</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">ssh</span> git@github.com<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><h3 id="4-Download-Node-js"><a href="#4-Download-Node-js" class="headerlink" title="4. Download Node.js"></a>4. Download Node.js</h3><p>Hexo is based on Node.js. Download Node.js <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">here</a>.<br>After you download it, use the following the command to check if your Node.js and npm is installed successfully. If you see the version number then you are good to go!</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">node</span> -v<span class="token function">npm</span> -v<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre><p>Now we are set up everything we need for start using hexo!</p><h2 id="Hexo"><a href="#Hexo" class="headerlink" title="Hexo"></a>Hexo</h2><p>Let’s begin using hexo and building our blog!</p><h3 id="5-Install-Hexo-and-init-a-blog-folder"><a href="#5-Install-Hexo-and-init-a-blog-folder" class="headerlink" title="5. Install Hexo and init a blog folder"></a>5. Install Hexo and init a blog folder</h3><p>Now we install hexo with npm:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">npm</span> <span class="token function">install</span> -g hexo-cli<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><p>Now that we have hexo installed, go to the directory that you want to build your blog. Let’s say I want my blog folder “myBlog” under “myDocuments”. You re-direct location of your command to “myDocuments” and type the following:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash">hexo init myBlog<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><img src="/2022/01/07/how-to-make-your-own-blog/init_blog.png" class="" loading="lazy"><p>Replace myBlog with whatever name you would like your blog to be.<br>Notice that you do not create the “myBlog” folder yourself. The init command following a name create the folder. To init hexo under an already existing (has to be empty) folder, re-direct location of your command under that folder (eg. <code>xxx/myDocuments/myBlog</code>) and type <code>hexo init</code>.</p><h3 id="6-Generate-and-display-blog"><a href="#6-Generate-and-display-blog" class="headerlink" title="6. Generate and display blog"></a>6. Generate and display blog</h3><p>We have a default hexo blog ready! Let’s use the following command to generate and display our blog.<br>In the myBlog directory, type the following command:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash">hexo generatehexo server<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre><p>Now, our hexo blog is live on our computer! Open a web browser and enter the following address:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-html" data-language="html"><code class="language-html">localhost:4000<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><img src="/2022/01/07/how-to-make-your-own-blog/empty_index.jpg" class="" loading="lazy"><p>If it is displaying, congrats!<br>You can close the sever with ctrl+c now.</p><img src="/2022/01/07/how-to-make-your-own-blog/oh.jpeg" class="" loading="lazy"><h3 id="7-Git-deploy-setting"><a href="#7-Git-deploy-setting" class="headerlink" title="7. Git deploy setting"></a>7. Git deploy setting</h3><p>Now we connect our hexo blog to our github repo.<br>In your github repo, click the green button “Code” with a little drop down arrow. Select SSH and copy the entire address that looks something like “<a href="mailto:&#x67;&#105;&#116;&#64;&#103;&#x69;&#x74;&#104;&#x75;&#x62;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;">&#x67;&#105;&#116;&#64;&#103;&#x69;&#x74;&#104;&#x75;&#x62;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#109;</a>:yourUserName/yourUserName.github.io.git”. <img src="/2022/01/07/how-to-make-your-own-blog/repo.png" class="" loading="lazy"><br>Find a file called “_config.yml” in the blog’s root directory and open it.<br>Copy and paste the following code to the end of the “_config.yml” file:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-none"><code class="language-none">deploy:  type: git  repo:  Paste_the_address_your_just_copied_here  branch: master<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre><p>Do not forget to change the repo address, and make sure the indentations before “type”, “repo”, “branch” is correct. Save the file.</p><blockquote><p>Note that there is another “_config.yml” in root/themes/ directory. This is the config file for themes that you use to change settings for your chosen theme later. the “_config.yml” in root is to change setting for your whole blog.</p></blockquote><h3 id="8-Deploy-your-blog"><a href="#8-Deploy-your-blog" class="headerlink" title="8. Deploy your blog"></a>8. Deploy your blog</h3><p>Go back to the command (under dir of the blog folder) and paste the following, this lets hexo directly deploy blog to github:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash"><span class="token function">npm</span> <span class="token function">install</span> hexo-deployer-git --save<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span></span></code></pre><p>Now we are good to deploy!<br>Type the following three command:</p><pre class="line-numbers language-bash" data-language="bash"><code class="language-bash">hexo cleanhexo generatehexo deploy<span aria-hidden="true" class="line-numbers-rows"><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code></pre><p>Congrats! Your blog is now deployed to your github! Visit it on a web browser with the url <a href="https://yourgithubusername.github.io/">https://yourGitHubUsername.github.io/</a>.</p><blockquote><p>A tip: you can use “hexo g” for “hexo generate” and “hexo s” for “hexo server”. Check <a href="https://hexo.io/docs/commands.html">here</a> for other useful commands.</p></blockquote><p>Every time you’d like to view your blog on your local server, use the command <code>hexo clean, hexo g, hexo s</code>. If you want to deploy it to github, use <code>hexo d</code>.</p><img src="/2022/01/07/how-to-make-your-own-blog/haha.jpeg" class="" loading="lazy"><h2 id="What’s-more"><a href="#What’s-more" class="headerlink" title="What’s more"></a>What’s more</h2><p>You are pretty much done with our basic structure of the blog! Yay!<br>Here is two more things you might consider doing with your blog.</p><h3 id="9-Pick-your-own-theme"><a href="#9-Pick-your-own-theme" class="headerlink" title="9. Pick your own theme"></a>9. Pick your own theme</h3><p>You can chose your theme <a href="https://hexo.io/themes/">here</a>. Hexo offers so many cool themes! Pick one that many people use for a better experience with more detailed guides around building the theme and more Q&amp;A as well as more people that is using the theme to help you.<br>There are many build-in personable features some themes provide. E.g. background, front, word count, key word search, comments.<br>Choose carefully if you want your blog to be a long term thing. You don’t want to invest months into a theme and later found out it does not have enough build-in features for you.<br>You can find a detailed guide on how to use any specific theme. Check out their theme’s README in the their github repo. They will lead you from now with more personalized themes!<br>Personally I picked my theme just because I love the click animation haha.</p><h3 id="10-Personalize-your-url"><a href="#10-Personalize-your-url" class="headerlink" title="10. Personalize your url"></a>10. Personalize your url</h3><p>You can personalize your unique url (will need you to pay and rent a domain). I’ll write it in a separate blog <a href="https://emerisly.com/2022/01/10/blog-with-personal-url/">here</a>!<br>It’s not that useful but it looks super cool!</p><h2 id="Some-more-useful-links"><a href="#Some-more-useful-links" class="headerlink" title="Some more useful links"></a>Some more useful links</h2><p>If you are an experienced programmer and want to deploy your blog onto your own server, check out <a href="https://blog.atcg.cc/2021/02/04/HowToBuildABlog/">this tutorial</a> made by Dawn.<br>I followed along this tutorial and made my first blog on a server. The pros are faster connections and more flexibilities, the cons are it’s more complicated and you also need to rent a server.</p><h2 id="The-End"><a href="#The-End" class="headerlink" title="The End"></a>The End</h2><p>Thanks!</p><img src="/2022/01/07/how-to-make-your-own-blog/mua.jpeg" class="" loading="lazy">]]></content>

Mom and dad got me flowers and cake. Love them. XD<br>Nothing much happened. Just normal relaxing days that I enjoy very much.<br>Did get my hands on some arduino projects and that was fun.</p><h3 id="One-Funny-Thing-maybe-not"><a href="#One-Funny-Thing-maybe-not" class="headerlink" title="One Funny Thing (maybe not)"></a>One Funny Thing (maybe not)</h3><p>I actually burned my laptop’s motherboard by accident. It was a long story… But the thing is, I lost everything in my hard drive.<br>And eh… Yea I was not ready to lose all my stuff in my computer. (Don’t worry for me, luckily I spam store all my codes on my github and important files on another hard drive so it wasn’t the literal end of the world)<br>But I did lost more than half of the work for this website since the configuration and setting up the website was the hardest part… The old server still is live (at least when I’m writing this blog) but I have no access to that old website.<br>Imagine you just finish solving the hardest math problem and you copied the answer down to a paper but later found out that your original work is missing. Now all you have is the correct answer to the question, and your professor asked where is your work to the answer.<br>After procrastinating for so long I finally recovered from the disaster and is ready to set up everything again. So yes everything you see right now is 100% re-built.<br>So, the moral of the story, save all your files on the cloud!

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Going-back-to-China"><a href="#Going-back-to-China" class="headerlink" title="Going back to China"></a>Going back to China</h2><p>Finally back to China after the long tiring trip… Not fun to travel internationally during COVID.<br>It’s been one week since I’ve landed in GuangZhou and things are going well!<br>Didn’t do much but enjoyed my rest hehehe.<br>Here is just a little bit to record my journey i guess?</p><h3 id="New-Jersey"><a href="#New-Jersey" class="headerlink" title="New Jersey"></a>New Jersey</h3><p>It was 5 AM. Yep. No sleep for 24 hours straight. Finished up my school work all day and packing the whole night - cause I have a plane to catch in 2 hours :)<br>It was a rush getting out of the house and leave for the airport. Wow. I’m actually leaving. Four years of high school, all packed up in my three suitcases I guess.<br>So dark out side. :( And can’t believe that will probably be my last time being in New Jersey for a while. I will miss the old fun days in high school.<br>Oh, it will be a shame to miss the final senior prom. Never got the chance to go to any high school dance (sad face). Too caught up with other things and just missing out I guess. (Hopefully I’ll have another chance in college?)<br>Still two months till graduation but… my high school life is probably ending now..? It’s been what a long joinery… Had my up and downs, but also many many lucky and happy things that will always keep a part of me smiling. &lt;3<br>Very grateful for getting into Cornell, and everything I have right now… XD</p><p>Here is some cute flowers for you! Shot in New Jersey.</p><img src="/2021/04/19/journey-to-home/flower.jpg" class="" loading="lazy"><h3 id="Los-Angeles"><a href="#Los-Angeles" class="headerlink" title="Los Angeles"></a>Los Angeles</h3><p>Ok. United Airlines. Always had to make things harder for me.<br>It was not fun to carry three suitcase and a super heavy bag alone when these luggages weight more than you up the stairs…<br>Did enjoy the hotel in LA though. The waiter there was so nice to carry all the luggages for me with a kind smile. I would not be able to make it to my room from the lobby without him hahaha. (He deserved all the tips in the world) Beds were super soft so loved it (yay). COVID test went smoothly too so hey! Nice job and a pat on the back for myself.<br>It was actually my first time in california. Planed to just sit in the airport all day (yea I’m a very boring person) till the airplane take off. Unexpectedly a very good friend of mine drove two hours to joined me and kept me company thought the whole day and showed me around LA. That was fun, so shot out to that great friend. XD</p><p>Oh can you find the hollywood sign in the picture?</p><img src="/2021/04/19/journey-to-home/LA.jpg" class="" loading="lazy"><h3 id="GuangZhou"><a href="#GuangZhou" class="headerlink" title="GuangZhou"></a>GuangZhou</h3><p>I live in Shanghai but no of course I have to land and quarantine for fourteen days in GuangZhou first. Well. Yea.<br>The trip was not easy with all my luggages but so many nice people helped me throughout the journey… wuwuwu wish the best for them. &lt;3<br>Oh the food in GuangZhou was so good… Got something new to try every day (and they are so good 99% of the time!!!)<br>Can’t wait to go back to Shanghai. A bit nervous actually. Haven’t went back home for two years now.<br>Well let me enjoy my fun time here in GuangZhou and I’ll write more (hopefully) when I’m back in Shanghai haha.</p><p>Yay. Almost home!</p><img src="/2021/04/19/journey-to-home/flight.jpg" class="" loading="lazy">]]></content>
